This guide is meant to serve as a walk-through regarding the use of the [Xilinx Petalinux tools](http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/PetaLinux?responseToken=03e1bb67ae0bfe14ce7c225634ac9f676) to configure and build [Xilinx Linux](https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx) for the [Zynq ZCU102](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-u1-zcu102-g.html).   The reader will also learn how to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) both on the PC and Zynq for the purpose of performing [containerized development](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3204171/linux/what-is-docker-linux-containers-explained.html).
### Docker: What and Why?
- [A Not Very Short Introduction To Docker](https://blog.jayway.com/2015/03/21/a-not-very-short-introduction-to-docker/)

Docker can most easily be explained as "```chroot``` on steroids".  If you have never used ```chroot```, it is a Linux utility that allows you to run an interactive shell with the root directory of your choice.  So if you had a hard-disk with a completely different Linux OS on it than the one on your host you could "enter" the file-system of that OS using ```chroot``` (given you are running the same architecture and kernel).  Docker utilizes this concept to produce "file-system images" called "Docker images" that can be packaged with various dependencies for a specific application.  The beauty of this is that you can configure your Docker image with whatever it needs to run an application and easily reproduce it in a variety of environments.  This approach and Docker in general was and is intended primarily for web developers  to reduce variability between development and production machines, however it can also be incredibly useful as a method to streamline the process of getting dependencies onto an embedded machine.  This is important in the case of the Zynq because it allows us to use Xilinx's Linux custom distribution to get the most functionality out of the Zynq's specialized architecture while gaining access to the richer tools and package managers of distributions such as Ubuntu or Arch.  Furthermore, we can use Docker to improve our Xilinx workflow on our host machines by producing Docker images for the various Xilinx SDKs.  The lengthy download and build times and squirrelly dependencies can make these SDKs a nightmare to install **especially on air-gapped machines**, however we can circumvent this with Docker.  We can adopt a **build once, use often** approach by having one developer go through the install process from within a Docker container, save and then distribute the image of that container.

## Installing Petalinux 2017.1 On Host Machine
#### Method 1: Install Natively Without Docker (Not Recommended)
##### Requirements:
 - [Petalinux v 2017.1 Installer (7.54 GB)](https://www.xilinx.com/member/forms/download/xef.html?filename=petalinux-v2017.1-final-installer.run&akdm=1) 
 ##### Instructions:
 See [Petalinux documentation](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2017_1/ug1144-petalinux-tools-reference-guide.pdf)
 #### Method 2: Install Using Docker (Preferred)
 ##### Requirements:
 - [petalinux-2017-1.tar.xz (7.6GB)]() (available by request over AMRDEC only)
 - [Host PC running Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) to install Docker on an air-gapped Linux machine please see the guide [below](#installing-docker-on-an-air-gapped-linux-machine)
##### Instructions:

 1. Unzip the compressed **petalinux-2017-1.tar.xz** image:
 ```bash
 $ tar xf petalinux-2017-1.tar.xz
 ```
 2. Ensure the Docker daemon is running on your host machine by connecting to it:
 ```bash
 $ docker info # docker commands may need to be run as root
 ```
 3. Load the decompressed **petalinux-2017-1.tar** image:
 ```bash
 $ docker load -i petalinux-2017-1.tar
 ``` 
 4. Check that the image was loaded properly:
 ```bash
 $ docker images
 REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
sicore/petalinux    2017.1              00f0a1152c7b        19 hours ago        14.8GB
 ```
5. Create Petalinux work directory with workspace subdirectory \<My petalinux work\>/workspace:
```bash
$ mkdir -p <My petalinux work>/workspace
```
6. Place the following script entitled run.sh into \<My petalinux work\>:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
WORKDIR=$PWD/workspace
VERSION=2017.1
docker run --rm -itv $WORKDIR:/home/petalinux/workspace sicore/petalinux:$VERSION
```
This script will run the **sicore/petalinux:2017.1** interactively (```-it```)  and sync the ```<My petalinux work>/workspace``` directory with the ```/home/petalinux/workspace``` directory (```v```), meaning that all of your work done inside the **sicore/petalinux:2017.1** container will be saved on your host machine in the ```/workspace``` directory.  This makes obtaining your build outputs much easier, **and any files you need Petalinux to access such as your BSP should go in this shared directory**.

7. Change permissions on run.sh to ensure it is executable:
```bash
$ chmod a+x run.sh
```

8. ```cd``` into your ```<My petalinux work>``` directory and run run.sh:
```bash
$ cd <My petalinux work> && ./run.sh
```
Repeat step 8 anytime you want to do some Petalinux work!

## Installing Docker on an Air-Gapped 64-bit Linux Machine
##### Requirements

 1. [docker-\<version\>-ce.tgz for your architecture (ex. x86_64, ~30MB)](https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/)
 2. [docker_daemon service script (4.0 KB)](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/JamesAnthonyLow/aa3a672915fa9b7ae516b7e5d16e53b3/raw/018294c309c30340728ef96efe05e77986bdd88c/docker_daemon)
 3. [check-config.sh (12.0 KB)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moby/moby/master/contrib/check-config.sh)
 4. [cgroupfs-mount (4.0 KB) *If needed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianon/cgroupfs-mount/master/cgroupfs-mount)
 5. [update-rc.d (already installed)](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/en/man8/update-rc.d.8.html)
 
 ##### Instructions (all steps can be performed as root without the ```sudo``` command)
 
 1. First check to make sure that your kernel satisfies the requirements for Docker by running check-config.sh:
```bash
$ chmod a+x && ./check-config.sh
```
The output should pass for all features in the **Generally Necessary** section, however **cgroup hierarchy** may fail but **this is OK we will fix it**.  If you are configuring your own kernel you can use the Docker guide from the [Gentoo Linux wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Docker)

2. (**If cgroup hierarchy failed initially**) run **cgroupfs-mount** and make sure it causes **cgroup hierarchy** to pass, otherwise you may have bigger issues with kernel compatibility:
```bash
$ chmod a+x cgroupfs-mount && ./cgroupfs-mount && ./check-config.sh
```
3. Untar **docker-\<version\>-ce.tgz**:
```bash
$ tar xvzf docker-<version>-ce.tgz
```
4. Move Docker binaries somewhere into ```/usr/bin``` which should already be in your ```PATH```:
```bash
$ sudo mv docker/* /usr/bin
```
5. Test Docker daemon:
```bash
$ sudo dockerd&
$ sudo docker info # should report a successful connection
```
6. (**If cgroup hierarchy failed initially**) move the **cgroupfs-mount** script into ```/etc/init.d``` and enable using **update-rc.d**:
```bash
$ sudo chmod a+x cgroupfs-mount && sudo mv cgroupfs-mount /etc/init.d
$ sudo update-rc.d cgroupfs-mount defaults 99 # ensure it runs before 100
```
7. Move the **docker_daemon service script** into ```/etc/init.d``` and enable using **update-rc.d**:
```bash
$ sudo chmod a+x docker_daemon && sudo mv docker_daemon /etc/init.d
$ sudo update-rc.d docker_daemon defaults 100 # ensure it runs after 99
```
8. Reboot and check to see that the Docker daemon started properly on its own:
```bash
$ sudo reboot
# After reboot
$ sudo docker info
```
9. (Optional) enable Docker usage without sudo for a user:
```bash
$ usermod -aG docker <user> # Add user to docker group
# If logged in, log out and log back in again
# Now you should be able to use docker commands without sudo
```  
10. Run Docker "Hello World":
```bash
$ docker run 'hello-world'
```
## Build Linux for the Zynq ZCU102 using the Xilinx BSP
##### Requirements
- [xilinx-zcu102-v2017.1-final.bsp (299.45 MB)](https://www.xilinx.com/member/forms/download/xef.html?filename=xilinx-zcu102-v2017.1-final.bsp&akdm=1)
- [SD Card (>=32 GB)](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-Class-Memory-SDSDUNC-032G-GN6IN/dp/B0143RT8OY)
- [USB SD Card Reader](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Reader-Memory-Windows-Simultaneously/dp/B01EFPX9XA/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1517588403&sr=1-6&keywords=sd+card+reader)

You will also need a *.bit wrapper file which can be produced with Vivado but since the production of the necessary FPGA files is outside the scope of this guide you can instead obtain a pre-built *.bit file from the TRD: [zcu102-base-trd-2017-1.zip (474 MB)](https://www.xilinx.com/member/forms/download/design-license.html?cid=6af8b7ef-685e-4338-83eb-c611bffb5839&filename=rdf0421-zcu102-base-trd-2017-1.zip).  Just download and unzip the directory and then copy the file at ```rdf0421-zcu102-base-trd-2017-1/apu/sdsoc_pfm/zcu102_base_trd/sw/prebuilt/zcu102_Base_trd_wrapper.bit``` to use as your FPGA design.

1. Create a new Petalinux project using **xilinx-zcu102-v2017.1-final.bsp** (board support package)
```bash
$ petalinux-create -t project â€“s xilinx-zcu102-v2017.1-final.bsp
```
This will create the directory ```xilinx-zcu102-2017.1```

2. Enter the new project directory and configure the bootloader:
```bash
$ cd xilinx-zcu102-2017.1 && petalinux-config
```  
An [ncurses](https://linux.die.net/man/3/ncurses) menu will pop up.  You need to select **SD card** as the **Root filesystem type** by selecting it in the menu ```Image Packaging Configuration ---> Root filesystem type (SD card)```.  After making the selection you can **save** and then **exit** the bootloader configuration menu.

3. Now is time for the hard part, configuring the kernel:
```bash
$ petalinux-config -c kernel
```
This will give you access to the kernel menu.  It is important that you enable all the features required by Docker.  This is all laid out nicely in the following graphic copied from the [Gentoo Linux Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Docker).  I highly recommend the [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org) as a resource for kernel configuration.  Any time you need use a utility that requires kernel support ([iptables](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Iptables) for example), just search for it in the Gentoo Wiki and copy the kernel configuration from there.

**Note:** It is important to keep in mind that some menu options will not show up until other dependencies are enabled. For example ```"ipvs" match support``` will not show up until you enable ```IP virtual server support```. If you have trouble finding anything you can bring up a search menu by typing ```/```.

4. Configure the Root file system:
```bash
$ petalinux-config -c rootfs
```
Once again it is important you include all of the [dependencies required by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/binaries/#prerequisites) including **update-rc.d** in order to enable running the Docker daemon at boot:
```

     misc  --->
         packagegroup-core-buildessential    --->
             [*] packagegroup-core-buildessential
        
```
**Save** and **exit**.

5. Finally it is time to build! This step can be somewhat time consuming especially the first time before Petalinux has had the chance to chance any of the outputs:
```bash
$ petalinux-build
```
6. We can format the **SD Card** while we wait for Petalinux to finish.  I am not sure what then actual minimum size of the SD Card can be but the more space the better, for this walk-through I used a 64 GB PNY SD Card.  You must format the SD Card as follows:
```
Partition Size   Type   LABEL
1         256M   FAT32  BOOT
2         REST   EXT4   Rootfs
```
The easiest way to do this on Ubuntu Linux is with the [gparted GUI](https://gparted.org/):
```bash
$ sudo gparted <Disk name>
# disk name can be found on the command line with lsblk
```
This will bring up a graphical menu representing the current contents of the disk.  Unmount and delete **all** current partitions by **right clicking** them and selecting the corresponding menu options. You should now have only **unallocated** space.  **Right click** the unallocated space and select **new**.  Here is what you should enter for your first **BOOT** partition:
```
Free space preceding (MiB): [<Leave alone>]   Create as:       [Primary Partition]
New size (MiB):             [256          ]   Partition name : [<Leave alone>    ]
Free space following (MiB): [<Leave alone>]   File system:     [fat32            ]
Align to:                   [<Leave alone>]   Label:           [BOOT             ]
```
Select **Add** when you are finished entering the correct parameters.  Now create the **second** partition by **right clicking** the unallocated space and clicking **new**:
```
Free space preceding (MiB): [<Leave alone>]   Create as:       [Primary Partition]
New size (MiB):             [<Leave alone>]   Partition name : [<Leave alone>    ]
Free space following (MiB): [<Leave alone>]   File system:     [ext4             ]
Align to:                   [<Leave alone>]   Label:           [rootfs           ]
```
Select **Add** to finish the second partition.  To finalize the changes click the **Edit** drop-down menu from the menu bar up top and select **Apply all operations**, select **Apply** and allow **gparted** to take care of the rest.

#### Installing Petalinux 2017.1

The recommended method to install Petalinux 2017.1 is to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on a compatible machine.  Just to be clear so that there is no confusion we would be using Docker on a host machine such as an Ubuntu Linux desktop in order to run an image that **already has Petalinux 2017.1 installed**.  While downloading and "building" the image is somewhat time consuming (I estimate ~20 minutes for each part), it consists of far less headaches than performing the installation using Xilinx's [install script](https://www.xilinx.com/member/forms/download/xef.html?filename=petalinux-v2017.1-final-installer.run&akdm=1) and is probably faster as well.  Once we have Petalinux installed we can use this tool to build and configure [Xilinx's linux distribution](https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx) to run on the Zynq ZCU102 where we will then install Docker to run other linux images.  So yes, we are using Docker to build Linux to install Docker to run Linux, it can be a bit [confusing](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IDDx.jpg).
